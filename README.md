GOOMBAServer - A Server-Side programming language for websites!

### Development now continues, sorry for no updates since march!! (15/12/2022)

GOOMBAServer is based on PHP, NodeJS, and ASP.NET (Easier explanation: server side languages for websites).
Using GOOMBAServer is free for everyone, But you should have some computer skills.
If you are using an unchanged GOOMBA.cfg file, just run GOOMBAServer.exe and go to http://localhost:8000/

It has been tested on:

# Compiling GOOMBAServer
Compiling GOOMBAServer is easy!

You need the MySQL.Data NuGet package installed first.
Go to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet packages for solution.
Then close Visual Studio, and open `Compile.vbs`
